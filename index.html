  <h1>Why Appitat?</h1>

  <div id="marketing">
    <div id="col-1">
      <img src="/img/design.png">
      <h3>Striking Design</h3>
      <p>
        With an all-metal brushed enclosure, ambiently illuminated top, and LED accents, Appitat is a computer you don't have to hide.
      </p>
      <p>
        Appitat is user serviceable, too. Remove the bottom cover to access the SD Card, Bluetooth / Wi Fi module, and other system components.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div id="col-2">
      <img src="/img/connected.png">
      <h3>Well Connected</h3>
      <p>
        Appitat seamlessly connects to your home internet service, making apps available for you to access from anywhere in the world. Simply plug it in, turn it on, and you'll be up and running in seconds.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you install an app, you can explicitly allow or deny it access to other apps / services on the Internet. And if you decide to completely remove an app, its data is securely erased forever. With Appitat, you're in complete control of your data.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div id="col-3">
      <img src="/img/developer.png">
      <h3>Developer Friendly</h3>
      <p>
        Stop worrying about infrastructure. With Appitat, scalability is a non-issue. Simply wrap your web app inside a Docker container, push it to the app market and it's available worldwide within seconds.
      </p>
      <p>
        For paid apps, give us your Bitcoin address and we'll broker the transaction for you for a 1% fee. Forget about app approvals, payouts, and country-specific currencies.
